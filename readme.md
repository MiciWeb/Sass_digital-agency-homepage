# Goal of the project
The project's aim is to create the home page of a digital agency, I did it before joining my school when i was learning front-end development as a self-taugh. 

## How I build this project
* I used the library [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) which is a great way to add good looking animation when the scroll trigger on the div.
* I also used my favorite preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), It's a script language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, it's brings a lot of features to basic Css like mixins, variables or loop.
* I applied the BEM methodology which is a super useful methodology to write html code especially combined with Sass because that naming convention avoid running into conflicts with other CSS names and facilitate the code writing.
* I find this project on [frontend-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), it's a cool website for front-end developers, there is in the challenge section of the site a bunch of visual mockup that you can try to recode and eventually post the result into a solution section.

## Launch the project
