# Goal of the project
The project is a simple home page of a digital agency that I did before joining my school when i was learning a lot front-end development I made it with the preprocessor Sass and the library AOS to animate the div when the scroll reach them.

## How I build this project
* I find this project on [frontend-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) which is a website for front-end developers where in the challenge section you can try to recode the front of many websites and post it into the solutions part.
* I used the library [Aoi](https://aoi.js.org/) which is a great way to add good looking animation when the scroll trigger on the div.
* Also i used my favorite preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) which is a language that is interpreted or compiled into Css and add a lot of features like mixins, variables and loop.

## Launch the project
* You can take a look on the project [here](https://sersour.com/Designo_Project/designo.html).
