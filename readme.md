# Goal of the project
The project is the home page of a digital agency that I did before joining my school when i was learning front-end development as a self-taugh. 

## How I build this project
* I used the library [Aoi](https://aoi.js.org/) which is a great way to add good looking animation when the scroll trigger on the div.
* Also i used my favorite preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) which is a language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS and add a lot of features like mixins, variables and loop.
* I applied the BEM methodology which is super useful especially with Sass because it's a naming convention that avoid running into conflicts with other CSS names and facilitate the code writing.
* I find this project on [frontend-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), it's a cool website for front-end developers which have in the challenge section a bunch of visual website that you can try to recode them and eventually post the result into the solution part.

## Launch the project
* You can take a look on the project [here](https://sersour.com/Designo_Project/designo.html).
